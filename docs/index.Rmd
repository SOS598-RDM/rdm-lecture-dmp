**ten simple rules**

1. determine the research sponsor requirements
2. identify the data to be collected
3. define how the data will be organized
4. explain how the data will be documented
5. describe how quality data will be assured
6. present a sound storage and preservation strategy
7. define the project data policies
8. describe how the data will be disseminated
9. assign roles and responsibilities
10. prepare a realistic budget

**7. define the project data policies**

- licensing and data-sharing arrangements
- human subject and other sensitive data

**8. describe how the data will be disseminated**

active, robust, and preferred approaches include:

- publishing the data in an open repository or archive
- submitting the data as appendices or supplements to journal articles
- publishing the data, metadata, and relevant code as a data paper

**9. assign roles and responsibilities**

roles may include:

- data collection
- data entry
- QA/QC
- metadata creation and management
- data preparation and submission to an archive
- systems administration.

**10. prepare a realistic budget**

Review your plan and make sure that there are lines in the budget to support the people that manage the data as well as pay for the requisite hardware, software

Some Michener words of wisdom

- engage your team
- plan from the start
- follow good advice
  + [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/)
  + institutional libraries (e.g., [ASU library guides](https://libguides.asu.edu/))
  + [EDI](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/)
- use good tools
  + [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/)
  + [DMPOnline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/)
- review and revise

*Remember that this is part of a proposal, and will contribute to the overall evaluation of the proposal.*

*It's not thinking, 'This is easiest for myself right now.' It's thinking, 'When I'm working on this next week, next month, right before I graduate — how do I set myself up so that it’s easier later?'*
